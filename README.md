## Platform Overview

Wenxin Large Model is a finance-domain large language model developed by Huabo Cloud (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. in collaboration with the technical team of Harbin Institute of Technology. Focused on the "finance brain", it deeply integrates finance-domain knowledge with reasoning and decision-making capabilities, empowering AI to directly solve enterprise problems.

The platform provides three working modes and five engines; the finance capabilities of Wenxin Large Model form the four intelligence capabilities. The model and the five engines together constitute the Enterprise AI Ontology, from which ten applications covering the entire finance chain grow. Applications are built on AI capabilities and can iterate and adjust quickly with business needs.

**Three Working Modes**

- **Menu-based** — use applications through function menus, ready out of the box
- **Skill-based** — encapsulate large-model capabilities as composable skills, orchestrated per scenario
- **Conversational** — talk to the large model to perform business operations directly; AI solves problems directly

**Four Intelligence Capabilities**

- **AI Office** — the conversational working capability of the large model, turning daily office tasks into natural language
- **AI Consulting** — management-consulting capability; finance expert knowledge is distilled into intelligent Q&A
- **AI Modeling** — dynamic modeling capability; indicators, rules and risk models are built dynamically with the business
- **AI Coding** — application generation capability; dynamic modeling, real-time coding, delivery anytime

The four intelligence capabilities run on top of the Enterprise AI Ontology and act on the enterprise's business objects and rules, forming a value loop from model capability to business execution.

| **AI Office** | **AI Consulting** | **AI Modeling** | **AI Coding** |

**Wenxin Agents**

The Wenxin Agent is the running unit that carries the four intelligence capabilities and executes business: on the Agent Platform, model capabilities, knowledge bases, tools and business processes are orchestrated together, applied to the Enterprise AI Ontology and distributed to business modules for use — covering the whole flow from building to using.

- **Build** — create applications on the Agent Platform (conversational or workflow type), visually orchestrate workflow nodes (LLM calls, knowledge retrieval, conditional branches, template conversion, code execution, tool calls, etc.), write prompts and configure model parameters; attach knowledge bases (upload enterprise policies and business documents for retrieval augmentation) and tool plugins, so agents acquire enterprise knowledge and business capabilities
- **Debug & Publish** — validate results through conversation debugging; publish applications upon confirmation and automatically obtain an API key; supports dual-track operation of draft debugging and published running
- **Authorize & Distribute** — in System Settings → Agent Management, distribute and authorize agents to business modules and members, controlling who can use what, and where
- **Use** — business users invoke agents through the AI assistant inside business modules, raising business requests via conversation; the agent understands and executes the corresponding business operations; direct business access via conversation is also supported
- **Audit Trail** — conversation history and running records are retained for review, supporting continuous agent optimization

**Five Engines**

Organization Engine · Role Engine · Process Engine · Form Engine · Rule Engine — the operational foundation that brings the large model into enterprise operation.

**Enterprise AI Ontology**

The Enterprise AI Ontology is the enterprise's digital twin and operating layer: it models the enterprise's organizational structure, business objects, relationships and control rules into a standardized knowledge system. Its foundation consists of three parts — enterprise-specific development templates constrain AI behavior norms, MCP tool integration connects enterprise knowledge and norms, and skill authorization defines capability boundaries and execution approvals. Wenxin Large Model runs on top of the ontology, becoming an AI that understands the enterprise's own structure, norms and business, continuously operating, learning and executing business within the enterprise.

**Platform Architecture**

Wenxin Large Model is structured in four layers from top to bottom: the large-model foundation, the five engines, the Enterprise AI Ontology, and the applications of the four intelligence capabilities. The large-model foundation provides finance-domain understanding, reasoning and decision-making; the five engines — organization, role, process, form and rule — model enterprise operating elements into a standardized knowledge system; together they constitute the Enterprise AI Ontology — the enterprise's digital twin and operating layer, accumulating business objects, relationships and control rules. The four intelligence capabilities run on top of the ontology, growing applications that cover the entire business chain of enterprise supervision and operation.

![Agile Audit built with Wenxin Large Model](images/09-minjieshenji.png)

## Feature Composition

### Audit Cockpit & Personal Workspace

The audit cockpit aggregates indicators such as active projects, rectification completion rate, audit findings, audit reports, unresolved issues and working-paper completion, giving an overview of audit posture; the personal workspace is the unified entry for tasks and to-dos.

### Audit Plan Preparation

Project-initiation suggestions are collected bottom-up (initiation notices, suggestion forms, leader-in-charge summaries, demand/suggestion forms and service demand forms) with two-level gating by professional and overall assessment; departure audits cover third-tier units (issuance, filling, aggregation) and second-tier/member units, with in-term audit detail management; engineering audits cover project cost, cost intermediate tables, construction/contractor/internal-external unit settlement summaries, two-dimensional summaries and sampling review tables, completion acceptance plans, project status and investment completion, plus settlement and final-account audit summaries; after the final plan is approved and filed, it goes into execution — annual planning runs online from demand collection to filing.

### Project Management

Engineering and financial audit project arrangement, project personnel reporting, engineering and financial supervision assignments, pre-audit investigation reports, project kickoff, implementation and work plans, task allocation, project extension requests, audit notification approval and issuance, notification changes — projects are managed end to end from arrangement, personnel and assignments to investigation and notification, with extensions and changes traceable.

### Audit Implementation

Audit task lists and audit commitment letters assign tasks and set discipline; audit working records, issue management (registering suspicions and verification), audit evidence sheets (evidence items and materials), my working papers and working paper management (review and aggregation), categorized audit findings, audit result confirmation; project payment recovery, supervision tasks, on-site review, project status tables, quality analysis reports, project viewing and archiving — field work is fully audit-trailed with quality analysis.

### Audit Reports

Opinion-exchange drafts, review reports, finalized audit reports, review work records, economic-responsibility audit result reports and audit opinions — reports follow the standard flow of opinion exchange, review and finalization.

### Audit Archives

Archive lists, archive borrowing and borrowing logs — after filing, borrowing follows the process and leaves traces.

### Audit Rectification

Issue lists, audit recommendations, issue rectification, follow-up visits and subsequent rectification — discovered issues form lists rectified item by item, follow-up visits ensure completion, and unfinished items enter subsequent rectification supervision.

### Quality & Appraisal

Rewards and penalties, quality review, score management, point-based assessment and quality review forms — project quality reviews and personnel point-based assessment link quality to performance.

### Research & Project Excellence

Research seminar notices, research submissions and ledgers, paper submission/ledgers/ranking, award notices; project excellence notices, applications, aggregation, selection, results and group selection — research outputs and outstanding projects have ledgers and incentives.

### Outcome Utilization

Working paper aggregation, project analysis, audit issue analysis, rectification issue analysis — multi-dimensional analysis of audit outcomes supports management insight into issue patterns.

### Basic Configuration

Audit institution management, audit object library, auditor management, evaluation management, audit templates, audit type and statistics type maintenance, audit issue types and audit document template library — basic data and document templates are unified for consistent calibers across the group.

## Business Process

The annual plan runs from project-suggestion collection and two-level assessment through departure and in-term audit arrangements and engineering settlement/final-account aggregation to final plan filing; during the project phase, task assignment, supervision assignments, pre-audit investigation, implementation plans and audit notifications are issued; during implementation, auditors take tasks and sign commitment letters, record working papers, manage suspicions, gather evidence and confirm results, forming audit findings; in the reporting phase, audit reports and opinions are issued after opinion exchange, review and finalization; archived projects are borrowed via the process; audit findings enter the rectification closed loop with follow-up visits; quality reviews and point-based assessment run throughout, and outcome-utilization analysis supports management decisions.

## Business Value

Agile Audit brings the entire audit process into the system: plans are prepared online from demand collection to filing; implementation assigns tasks to individuals with working papers, evidence and suspicions fully audit-trailed; reports are finalized through standard review; issues enter the rectification closed loop with follow-up visits; quality reviews and point-based assessment reward quality; the cockpit shows audit posture at a glance — improving audit efficiency and standardization together.

## Repository Contents

| Service | Port | Description |
|---|---|---|
| springboot-hbyunOilAudit | 8067 | Industry audit service |
| springboot-hbyunCentralEnterprisesAudit | 8681 | Central enterprise audit service |
| doc/ | — | [Backend Service Startup Guide](doc/后端服务启动说明.md): build configuration, database preparation, sanitization reference, startup steps and troubleshooting |

Issues found in audit enter the Rectification & Accountability module (Wenxin Large Model Rectification & Accountability Module) to form a rectification closed loop; the platform depends on the registry, gateway, system module and AI large-model services provided by the base module repository.

## Tech Stack & Startup

- Tech stack: Spring Boot / Spring Cloud (Eureka + Gateway), JDK 1.8, Maven 3.6+, DM/MySQL database, Redis.
- Startup order: first start the registry and gateway from the base module repository, then start the services as needed: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
- Before the first build, install the offline jars (DM driver etc., see the `repository` directory of the base module repository); see the [Backend Service Startup Guide](doc/后端服务启动说明.md) for details.
- The code is sanitized: database passwords, secrets and IPs are placeholders; replace them with real environment configuration (application-dev.yml) before startup.
